* TODO Tune the generate algorithm
 * maybe do multi-splits (n horiz or vert splits instead of 1)
 * evolve standard variance through tree
 * change odds of splitting through tree
 * ordering of splits (in a ring/seq)
 * color distribution/adjacency/size dependence
* DONE Make images easily refreshable with ring
